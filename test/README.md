test
===

Root directory for `trivial` package test cases.

Each folder here contains 2 important files:
- `pass.rkt` : driver for tests exercising intended behavior
- `fail.rkt` : driver for tests that should raise type errors

Run either of these to see a few pass/fail tests.
The scripts `all-X.rkt` in this folder run passing/failing tests.
