@title{Correctness}

Our implementation of @racket[format] in @todo{figure-ref} exhibits a few desirable properties.
@itemlist[
  @item{}

Generally speaking these properties are the ``right'' way to judge if a transformation is correct.



Open question: can we design a restricted macro language where every transformation
 is statically checked to ensure termination and correctness.
