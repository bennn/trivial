trivial @ icfp 2016, hopefully
===

1. Intro
   - Simple + Macros ~~~ Dependent
   - Obvious to programmer now obvious to type system
   - On the shoulders of Herman / Menier
   - Examples
2. Solution sketch
   - Key functions / metafunctions
   - Formulate requirements for all languages
3. Examples
   - Our implementation does X,Y,Z
   - Limitations
4. Implementation
   - How it works, quickly
   - Full impl. of format, addition
   - Partial impl. of regexp-match, vector-ref
5. Correctness
   - Desirable properties of implementation
   - General requirements
   - Open question: correct-by-construction
6. Related Work
   - Herman + Menier
   - Dependent Types
   - Hasochism
   - Do we need dependent types
7. Conclusion
   - idk
