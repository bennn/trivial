Thanks!

1. The purpose of this pearl is to describe a language-agnostic technique
   for augmenting the type systems of functional languages
   --- via libraries that any programmer may implement and prove correct.

2. Typed Racket serves as the vehicle for sample implementations of a
   range of concrete augmentations --- only because it allows us to fit the
   entire core implementation into the paper (Sections 5.1 and 5.2).

3. It is correct that neither our elaboration mechanism nor our examples in
   Section 3 are new. That is precisely why this is a *pearl* and
   not a research paper.

   Like any functional pearl, ours demonstrates a novel combination of
   old ideas.

   * Any programmer can use our technique to implement a type system
     augmentation as a library. The Typed Racket implementation is validation.

   * Our technique is compositional. All examples are implemented with local
     transformations. The macro expander composes these transformations into a
     structurally recursive traversal.

   * The guarantees for an augmented type system are as strong as the
     guarantees for a type system designed in a holistic manner.

     The proof obligations for such basic guarantees are stated explicitly
     in Section 2.

     Specific guarantees like "the augmented division function raises
     compile-time errors when called with 0 denominators" are theorems
     that may be stated and proven correct in the same way that Haskell's or
     ML's type systems are proven correct.

     The code samples in Section 3 are chosen precisely because they suggest
     theorems that a programmer might wish to prove. Doing so, however, is
     beyond the scope of a pearl that demonstrates how unusual but elegant
     functional code can achieve this highly desirable goal.

#### RA RB, re: `(printf "~a")`

   Calling `(printf "~a")` raises an arity error in our implementation because
   "~a" is a valid format specifier yet `printf` is called with zero additional
   arguments.  Calling `(printf "~b")` would give the same arity error.
   These both compile in Typed Racket and fail at runtime.

   But writing `(printf "~a")` was a typo on our part. We intended to use "~s".

#### RA RB, re: translating the ideas to Typed Clojure, Scala, and Rust

  These languages have sufficiently powerful syntax extensions.

  Clojure's macros will run arbitrary Clojure code at compile-time.
  Scala's compiler plugin API [1] allows custom source code transformations.
  Rust's compiler plugins [2] are on-par with Scala's.

#### RA, re: Dialyzer

   The Dialyzer belongs in our discussion of related work.
   Its guarantees match our third requirement for elaborations:
   statically rejected programs will go wrong at runtime.

   The PEPM'13 paper is interesting, but orthogonal to our pearl.

   - We are seeking to catch more runtime errors statically and allow more
     dynamically-correct programs that fail to typecheck as written.

   - Sagonas, Silva, and Tamarit are computing program slices to improve
     the quality of type error messages.

   But their technique would be very useful for Typed Racket.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### RA, re: using `#false` in interpretations

   This was a careless error on our part.
   We meant to use a unique sentinel value, such as a gensymed symbol.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### RB, re: "most languages fail at runtime" on printf

   gcc does indeed print a warning for invalid and mismatched format specifiers.
   It also complains when called on non-literal strings.
   OCaml also catches printf type errors and as RA points out Haskell has a
   library for safe formatting.

   We will say "many languages fail" instead of "most".


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### RC, re: flow of Sec. 3

   RC writes:

       "The example calls ... don't really drive the point home.
        I would have expected a couple of examples along the
        following lines: here is what I have to write without the
        system and here is what I can write using the system."

   This is an easy-to-fix weakness of our presentation.
   We will clarify the problems solved by each example.
